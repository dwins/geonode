GeoNode's documentation!
========================

First Steps
===========

The following documents give an overview to GeoNode.
:doc:`/intro/overview` is targeted at non-technical audiences and :doc:`intro/install` at people who just want to get it installed and will come back later to the complete documentation.

For Users
=========

GeoNode users can work with just a web browser, but may take advantage of existing tools like Quantum GIS or ESRI's ArcGIS.
This section provides some tutorials to help users discover what GeoNode's web-based mapping tools can do.
