Uploading data
==============

To upload data to a GeoNode site, first :doc:`linkme` register and log in.
Once you are logged in, you can click the "Data" link near the top of any GeoNode page, taking you to the page used for :doc:`/users/tour/data`.
Below the search form, find the link to :guilabel:`Upload a new layer`.
This brings you to the data upload form.

   Uploading a Shapefile with data about bridges

When uploading a layer, the only necessary part of the form is the file - a generic title, abstract, and style will be generated for you automatically based on the filename.
Of course, it's useful to specify a useful title and abstract to ensure that your data shows up in search results for relevant terms.
It is possible to update the metadata after the upload is completed.
If access to a layer needs to be restricted, please ensure that the correct security permissions are set before submitting the form: as soon as you do the layer will be discoverable through search and accessible through GeoNode's :abbr:`OWS (Open Web Services)` services.

Upon successful import of the data GeoNode will bring you to the metadata form for the layer.
See :doc:`linkme` for more information about editing metadata in GeoNode.
