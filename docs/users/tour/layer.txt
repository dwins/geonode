Layer details
=============

There are a number of ways to get to a layer's detail page in a GeoNode site.
If you know a layer's name or some keywords it uses, you can use use :doc:`/users/tour/data` to find it.
Layers that you own will appear on your :doc:`linkme` profile page.
GeoNode maps list links to their layers in the sidebar on their own :doc:`linkme` detail pages.
Of course, if you are already viewing the detail page for a layer, you can use your browser's bookmark function to save it for later, or copy the link to an email or instant message to share it with someone else.

   The detail page for a layer shows a preview map of the layer, some additional information about the layer, and a sidebar with relevant links and tools.


Preview map
-----------

The map in this page lets you navigate the data spatially.
   
* The identify button toggles identify mode for the map.
  While identify mode is active (denoted by the button staying "depressed") you can click on a feature on the map to see detailed information about it.

* To navigate the map, you can click on the arrow controls in the top left of the map.
  To change the map scale, you can drag the slider immediately below the pan arrows.
  Dragging the slider up shows more detail; dragging it down increases the size of the visible area.

* The scale is reported in the bottom right corner of the map, both as a scale line and a ratio.
  The ratio is displayed in a drop-down control; you can click on it and select among the available scales precisely.

* There are also some shortcuts: if you have a mouse wheel, you can scroll up and down to zoom in and out respectively.
  Additionally, if you hold the :kbd:`Shift` key down you can recenter and change scale in one motion by dragging a box around a region of interest.

* The layer menu on the toolbar lets you select among several background layers to provide context for the data.
  If none of the available backgrounds make the data clearly visible, you can choose :menuselection:`No background` to view your data by itself.

Links and tools
---------------

Downloading data
................

As nice as it is to have a layer available as a web page, sometimes it's useful to have a local copy of the data.
The :guilabel:`Download` section in the sidebar of the layer page offers full data or pre-rendered map images in a variety of formats.

Styling
.......

GeoNode allows each layer to have as many styles as users care to design.
If a layer has multiple styles, you can select among alternatives in the :guilabel:`Styles` section of the sidebar.
Each style here is accompanied by link to the :abbr:`SLD (Styled Layer Descriptor` for the style, which you can download for your own uses.

If you are :doc:`linkme` logged in, you can also edit styles and create new ones for the layer.
Click on a style's name to edit the style, or click the :guilabel:`Create new style` link to create a new one.

See :doc:`linkme` for more information on editing styles in GeoNode.

Management (Metadata and updating the layer)
............................................

If you have permission to edit a layer, GeoNode will offer you some extra links in the sidebar.

:guilabel:`Update the description of this layer` lets you edit the title, abstract, and other metadata for the layer.
Having correct metadata will help other users to find your data in search, so make sure to describe it well.
See :doc:`linkme` for more information on editing metadata in GeoNode.

:guilabel:`Upload a new version of this layer` lets you upload a new Shapefile to replace the existing layer.
Be careful!
Some styles may depend on specific attribute names, so this operation can cause existing maps to stop rendering properly.
To avoid this, make sure that attribute names are consistent when you update a layer.
However, if problems arise, you can simply delete the problematic styles, or edit them to reflect the new attribute names.

:guilabel:`Remove` allows you to permanently remove a layer from the GeoNode site.
This does not prevent other users from reusing the same name, so if you are concerned about broken links it may be better to restrict access to the layer instead.

Permissions
...........

For layers that you own, or where the owner has granted you administrative privileges, you can edit permissions in the layer detail page too.

The layer permissions are broken up into three lists of users:

* **Who can view this data?** determines which users are even allowed to browse to the layer page.
  Setting this to "anyone" means that anyone in the world can access the layer and download it.
  Setting it to "any registered user" means that anyone with an account on the GeoNode site can access the layer.
  Otherwise, only users with permissions to edit (see below) will be able to see the layer.

* **Who can edit this data?** determines which users can make modifications to the metadata or upload a new version of the data.
  Setting this to "any registered user" allows anyone with an account on the GeoNode site to make those changes.
  Otherwise, you can specify a list of specific users who will be allowed to edit the layer.
  Users with edit permissions implicitly have view permissions as well.

* **Who can manage and edit this data?** lets you provide an additional list of users with permission to grant other users permissions to the layer.
