Data search
===========

To find data in a GeoNode site, use the "Data" link in the GeoNode navigation tabs.
This brings you to GeoNode's data search page.

   Searching for rain data in the GeoNode site

You can search by just entering a keyword or phrase describing the topic you are interested in.
If you want to browse all data in the GeoNode site, or to filter by geographic area instead of subject matter, click the :menuselection:`Advanced Search` link below the search form.

Further down on this page there is a link to let you add your own data to the GeoNode site.
You can read more about loading data at :doc:`/users/tour/upload`.

Search results
==============

After entering a search term, you are taken to a new page containing the results of your search.

   The search results from the "rain" query

Let's take a look at the controls on this page.

*  A search form appears on this page again, allowing you to refine your search if it produces too many results, or to search for something else entirely.

*  An interactive map allowing you to search for data only in some region of interest.
   To choose a region of interest, use the pan and zoom controls on the map to navigate to the region.
   When you are happy with the map region, use the :menuselection:`Refine` button below the map to update your search results.

*  A list of the search results are presented in a grid.
   Each item in the grid has an "expand" button, a title, and a checkbox.

      Clicking on an entry's title will open the information page for the layer.

      Checking the checkbox will mark that layer as selected, allowing you to include it in a bulk download or a new map.

      Clicking on the "expand" button will display more information about the layer, and allow you to download the data in various formats.

   Some items also have a globe icon indicating that those search results are for layers not hosted in the GeoNode site.
   Operations for those layers will be limited: for example, GeoNode can't control permissions for remote layers. 

*  A "basket" of selected data.
   If you mark a layer's checkbox in the search results, the layer will be added to the basket.
   After selecting one or more layers, you can use the basket to easily download them all or create a map with those layers as a starting point.
   See :doc:`linkme` for more information about map composition.
