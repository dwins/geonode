Tour of GeoNode
===============

GeoNode's features are spread out across several pages - we try to make everything its own page so that everything can be linked on the web.
This section of the manual provides a guide to the layout and features of the pages in a basic GeoNode installation.
Of course, some GeoNode sites may modify the layout or add new pages, so things may not align 100% with your GeoNode site.

GeoNode conventions
===================

GeoNode tries keep things organized.
To see some basic reference points in GeoNode pages, let's take a look at the GeoNode home page.

First, let's look at the header for the page.

1. In the top left you can see a big GeoNode logo - although it it quite common for an organization running a GeoNode to use its logo instead of the default GeoNode one.
   From any page, you can always use the logo link to get back to the GeoNode home page.

2. At the top right, you can see whether or not you are logged in.
   If you don't have an account or you've logged out, GeoNode puts a link here to allow you to log in, or :doc:`linkme` register for an account.
   Once you've logged in, this area switches to tell you your username.
   There are links here to allow you to visit and edit your :doc:`linkme` user profile, and to log out of the site.

3. Directly below the logo, GeoNode provides some convenient links for accessing commonly used parts of the site.
   While your site may include additional pages or tools here, GeoNode includes the following links by default.

   * The **Home** link takes you to the GeoNode home page.

   * The **Data** link takes you to the :doc:`linkme` layer search page.

   * The **Maps** link takes you to the :doc:`linkme` map search page.

4. At the far right end of the tab bar, there is also a language selector.
   Choosing a different language here will activate a different translation for the GeoNode site, but titles and descriptions for layers and maps will still be in the language used by their authors.

Content
-------

After the header, the main content of the page begins.
Most pages in GeoNode split their main content into two sections.
The main section focuses on presenting information such as search results or a map preview, while a sidebar provides related tools and links.
Since the information presented on the home page is just tools and links already, it does not have a side bar.
However, a good example of a page using this layout is the :doc:`linkme` layer information page.
