About GeoNode
=============

GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data.
The project aims to surpass existing spatial data infrastructure solutions by integrating robust social and cartographic tools.

At its core, GeoNode incorporates GeoServer, Django, and GeoExt to provide a platform for sophisticated web-based spatial visualization and analysis.
Atop this stack, the project has built a map composer and viewer, tools for analysis, and reporting tools.


Online demo
===========

A live demo of the latest stable build is available at `demo.geonode.org`_. 

Anyone may sign up for a user account, upload and style data, create and share maps, and change permissions.
Since it is a demo site, we donâ€™t make any guarantee that your data and maps will always be there.
But it should hopefully allow you to easily preview the capabilities of GeoNode.

Geospatial data storage
=======================

GeoNode allows the upload vector and raster data in their original projections using a web form.
Vector data is uploaded in ESRI Shapefile format and satellite imagery and other kinds of raster data are uploaded as Geotiffs.

Special importance is given to standard metadata formats such as TC211. 
After an upload is finished, GeoNode presents the user with a form to fill in the metadata, which is then  made available using a standard `CSW`_ interface.

GeoNode also provides a web-based styler, allowing users to change how the data looks and preview the changes interactively with just a web browser.

To read more about GeoNode's data management, see :doc:`/users/upload`.

Data mixing and map creation
============================

Once data has been uploaded, GeoNode users can search for it geographically or via keywords and use it to create maps. 
These maps can incorporate other data from around the web, including popular base layers such as OpenStreetMap and Bing.
Once maps are saved, it is possible to embed them in any webpage or export to PDF for printing.

To read more about GeoNode's map composition tools, see :doc:`/users/create`.


GeoNode as a building block
===========================

A handful of other Open Source projects, like `Risk in a Box`_ extend GeoNode's functionality by tapping into the re-usability of Django applications.

The development community is very supportive of new projects and contributes ideas and guidance for newcomers.
